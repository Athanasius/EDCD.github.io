        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This guide will help you in understanding how most of the <b>3rd party</b> tools of Elite Dangerous works.
            You need no previous knowledge to follow this guide. So, let's dive into it.
        </p>
        <h3>What is this guide about anyway?</h3>
        <p>
            Elite Dangerous is a vast and complex game and there are many different moving parts in the game. Although
            in-game tools have improved over the years, it still becomes very difficult to progress in the game by only
            using them. As such, many players of the game have created their own tools available outside the game which
            greatly enhances the ease of playing Elite Dangerous. <b>These tools are not the official tools of Elite
            Dangerous
            and their developers have no affiliation to Frontier Developments.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Please keep in mind that these tools are created and maintained by developers for free in their free time at
            a best effort basis. Some of these developers can be supported via various channels. If possible, please
            support their efforts. Links would be available in the respective locations of the tools.
        </p>
        <h3>What are these tools and where can I find them?</h3>
        <p>
            You can find links to some of these tools in the <a href="index.html">homepage</a>. You can find more at
            <a href="http://edcodex.info/">Elite:Dangerous Codex</a>. There are a vast number of tools, big or small
            that you might discover but these should be enough to get you started.
        </p>
        <h3>What am I supposed to do with these tools?</h3>
        <p>
            Like all great questions, the answer is; it depends. There are broadly 2 types of tools:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Client tools, running on your PC
            </li>
            <li>
                Browser based tools, running on some remote server and accessed using your web browser
            </li>
        </ol>
